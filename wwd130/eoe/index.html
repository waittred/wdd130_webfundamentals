      <h2>What Exactly is Eosinophilic Esophagitis?</h2>
      <p>Esophagitis or EoE for short can affect infants, children, teens, and adults. Symptoms can vary by age, individual, and severity.</p>  
      <p>EoE is a rare disorder of the esophagus. In medical terms, the disease is classified as an “immune-mediated” disease. Therefore, it is more complicated to explain. 
    <p>To simplify an explanation of the disease, watch the videos for further explanation.</p>

            <p>To date, there isn’t a known cause of why individuals get EoE. However, medical scientists have discovered that many who have EoE also have food and environmental
            allergies. Recently, scientists have made great strides in identifying several genes that may play a role in EoE, giving hope for future EOE treatments. 
            Currently, there is no cure for EoE. </p>
            <p>There is a saying among the EoE community: Hard to say. Even harder to live with.</p>

            <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>  
        
            <p>Eosinophils are microscopic cells that are spherical. The cells are clear in your body, but under a microscope, an acidic dye changes the cell’s color to be examined.
           The dye changes the cell to a purple or pink color. </p>
        <p>On May 15, 2007, The U.S. House of Representatives passed House Bill 296, recognizing the third week of May as National Eosinophil Awareness Week. </p>
